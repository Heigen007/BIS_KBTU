## Platform to build your own AI chatbots

I see a problem in a world where people own millions of businesses, but are not able to integrate AI into their business. I want to solve this problem by creating a platform where people can build their own AI chatbots without any coding skills.

You jsut create your chatbot, make him learn from your data and integrate it into your business.
After you create your chatbot you recieve an id and can use LUNA AI`s API to integrate it into your business in any way you want.
